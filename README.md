# Normalize Indentation 2

> forked into new project from abandoned plugin at https://github.com/Ennosuke/Normalize-Indentation (sorry dude, you seem to be unavailable)

An ST3 plugin to fix tabs/spaces indentation in source code.
 
- updated and improved to support `*.sublime-syntax` in addition to venerable `*.tmLanguage`;
- now correctly works with some edge cases:
    - file being to short for ST's internal indentation guesser to work;
    - mixed space/tab indentation.
