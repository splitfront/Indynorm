# Normalise Indentation mk2

> NB: this is a remake of abandoned [`Normalize Indentation`](https://github.com/Ennosuke/Normalize-Indentation) plugin â€” please uninstall it first!

A plugin to normalise indentation of text files according to local preferences. 

Usecase: 

- you prefer your code space-indented, 2 spaces per level of indentation;
- you're looking at a 4-spaces-per-level tab-indented file;
- it makes your brain itch;
- Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I, problem solved.

Features:

- _theoretically_, it should work with ST2, but I will not support it;
- added support for `*.sublime-syntax` (in addition to venerable `*.tmLanguage`);
- now correctly works with mixed space/tab indentation.

## Compatibility and possible conflicts

Before installing this version, __please remove the predecessor__, which doesn't work with ST3 anyway. To avoid possible collisions, I used `normaliSe` instead of `normaliZe` whereever possible  (command itself, menu items, names of configuration files &c). 

## Auto-detection of indentation:

Since ST build 4050, built-in indentation detector works fine with almost anything, but if you're on earlier build, I highly recommend to install [`AutoSetIndentation`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutoSetIndentation):

- it works with short files (less than 10 lines of code);
- it's smarter with edge cases and weird stuff.

## Looking into:

- "to and fro" conversion (doesn't look like a good idea -- needs a git hook and extra lines in `.gitignore`, but maybe):
    - `Ctrl+Alt+I` sets indentation to personal preference;
    - `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I` sets it to built-in language standart.
- move menu item to `View > Indentation`;
- add menu item to windows's `Spaces/Tabs` menu;
- support per-project/per-language preferences?
